# cashewbot
Rework of my Discord bot written using discord.py. An amalgamation of ideas stolen from other bots, + a few of my own.

If you'd like to add this bot to your server, you can use [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=706534185992454198&permissions=67628112&scope=bot) (I'd rather you didn't run your own instance, ty).

### Neat features:
- in-Discord Uno games
- language translation and auto-translator channels (via Yandex Translate)
- NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day command
- server-bound birthdays
- OpenWeatherMap command
